# Urban Climate Resilience Platform

A platform that uses Bayesian statistical models to predict climate change impacts on urban infrastructure and suggest cost-effective adaptation strategies.

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive analytics platform for urban climate resilience, with an initial focus on flood risk in Singapore. The platform leverages Bayesian statistical methods to provide probabilistic predictions with uncertainty quantification.

## Features

- Bayesian hierarchical modeling of climate risks
- Infrastructure vulnerability assessment
- Economic optimization of adaptation strategies
- Visualization of spatial risk patterns
- Uncertainty quantification for decision support
